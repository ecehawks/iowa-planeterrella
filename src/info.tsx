    text: '\n\nAurora are created when the solar wind (a stream of charged particles ' + 
    'coming from the Sun) becomes trapped by the Earth\'s magnetic field and can be ' + 
    'deflected into the Earth\'s upper atmosphere toward the magnetic poles. The Earth ' + 
    'is constantly in the flow of the solar wind, but when it’s stronger than usual, due ' + 
    'to a solar storm or a solar flare, then the wind can be more powerful and cause the ' + 
    'aurora to extend to lower latitudes.The most powerful auroral event in modern times ' + 
    'took place on August 28 - September 2, 1859 and was called the Carrington Event. If a ' + 
    'similar event occurred today, it would cause widespread damage to modern technologies ' + 
    'including satellites, power systems, and telecommunications. This threat has generated ' + 
    'an increased interest in space weather forecasting.Aurora are also present on other planets ' + 
    'with magnetic fields and atmospheres. For example, they have been observed on Jupiter and Saturn.',

    text: '\n\nA century ago, Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland (1867-1917) ' + 
    'hypothesized that the aurora on Earth are caused by plasma streaming out from ' + 
    'the Sun that gets trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field, causing currents in ' + 
    'the polar regions of the upper atmosphere. To test this hypothesis, Birkeland ' + 
    'led the “Norwegian Polar Expedition” from 1899 to 1900, which provided the first ' + 
    'evidence (using ground based magnetic field measurements) of the current patterns ' + 
    'in the polar region. Today, these are knows as the Birkeland currents. The ' + 
    'existence of Birkeland currents was debated scientifically until a direct measurement ' + 
    'was made in 1963 from the Navy satellite 1963-38C. ' +
    '\n\nUpon returning from his expedition, Birkeland designed the “Terrella” experiment ' + 
    'to study the interaction of plasma and magnetic fields in and effort to better ' + 
    'understand the physics associated with the Earth-Sun interaction. Birkeland also ' + 
    'made several other major contributions to science and technology. He invented ' + 
    'the coil gun, and was the first to develop an industrial-scale method for nitrogen ' + 
    'fixation from air (the Birkeland-Eyde process). Nitrogen fixation is the essential ' + 
    'process needed to produce ammonia for farm fertilizer. Birkeland was nominated ' + 
    'for a Nobel prize seven times. Learn more about Kristian Birkeland here.',
